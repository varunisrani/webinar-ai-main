I'm reaching out because we have an incredible 5-video campaign opportunity that I think would be perfect for your audience and style. Do you have a few minutes to hear about this exciting collaboration?"

If they sound busy or hesitant: "I totally get it, you're probably juggling a million creative projects! Would there be a better time to chat? This campaign is really something special and I'd love to share the details when you have a moment to fully focus."

### Creator Discovery & Engagement

5. Platform preferences: "Which platforms are you most excited about creating for right now?"

### Campaign Pitch & Alignment
1. Campaign overview: "So here's what we're thinking - we want to partner with you for a 5-video series that authentically showcases [brand/product]. Each video would highlight different aspects while staying true to your unique style."
2. Creative freedom: "The best part? We're giving you complete creative control. We trust your instincts about what works for your audience. We'll provide the product and key messaging points, but the storytelling is all you."
3. Compensation & benefits: "We're offering [compensation structure] plus you get to keep all the products featured. Plus, this could lead to a longer-term brand ambassador relationship if everything goes well."

For creators who aren't aligned: "I totally respect that this might not be the right fit for you right now. Your authenticity is what makes your content so powerful, so it's important you only partner with brands that feel right.
