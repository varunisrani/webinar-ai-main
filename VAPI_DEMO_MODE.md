# Vapi AI Agent Demo Mode Solution

## Problem
The application was encountering a **400 Bad Request** error when trying to connect to Vapi AI assistants:

```
VAPI error: Response
error: {message: "Couldn't Get Assistant. `assistantId` 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440004 Does Not Exist.", error: 'Bad Request', statusCode: 400}
```

This occurred because the default AI agents in the application used mock/demo assistant IDs that don't exist in your actual Vapi account.

## Solution
Implemented a **Demo Mode** fallback system that:

1. **Detects mock assistant IDs** - Checks if assistant ID starts with `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716`
2. **Simulates AI agent behavior** - When using mock IDs, the app enters demo mode instead of trying to connect to Vapi
3. **Provides visual feedback** - Shows "(Demo Mode)" in toasts and agent descriptions
4. **Graceful error handling** - Better error messages for actual Vapi connection issues

## Components Updated

### 1. AIAgentParticipant.tsx
- Added demo mode detection in `connectAIAgent()`
- Simulates connection, speaking activity, and timer functionality
- Shows "Demo Mode" in success messages

### 2. AutoConnectCall.tsx  
- Added demo mode detection in `startCall()`
- Simulates call connection and audio setup
- Provides countdown timer and speaking simulation

### 3. data.ts
- Updated all default agents to include `isDemoMode: true`
- Added "(Demo Mode)" to agent descriptions
- Maintains backward compatibility

## How It Works

### For Mock Agents (Demo Mode):
- **No actual Vapi API calls** are made
- **Simulated behavior** includes:
  - Connection status changes
  - Speaking animations
  - Call timers
  - Audio setup (for AutoConnectCall)

### For Real Agents:
- **Normal Vapi API calls** proceed as expected
- **Enhanced error messages** for better debugging
- **Backward compatible** with existing functionality

## Creating Real AI Agents

To use actual Vapi assistants instead of demo mode:

1. **Create an assistant in your Vapi dashboard**
2. **Copy the real assistant ID** 
3. **Either:**
   - Replace the mock ID in your webinar configuration
   - Create a new custom agent with the real assistant ID

## Benefits

- ✅ **No more 400 errors** from non-existent assistants
- ✅ **Demo functionality** works out of the box
- ✅ **Clear indication** when in demo vs. real mode
- ✅ **Graceful degradation** for development/testing
- ✅ **Better error messages** for debugging

## Testing

The app now handles these scenarios gracefully:

1. **Mock assistant IDs** → Demo mode with simulated behavior
2. **Real assistant IDs** → Normal Vapi connections
3. **Invalid real IDs** → Clear error messages with guidance
4. **Network issues** → Proper error handling and user feedback
